The code has been ported from Microchip Studio to PlatformIO. 
If running on another platform, you must modify the header file with function definitions.
The program is designed to work 24/7. Its task is to turn on the light after dark for a specified period of time, or until the batteries discharge.
The first battery charge is very time-consuming to record 
the maximum battery voltage in order to calculate the nominal and minimum voltage.
The main.h file should be set to the nominal and maximum voltage: max voltage = 100%nominal voltage = (define % < 100)
minimum voltage (define % < 100%). This is very important.
The program assumes the use of lithium batteries. Regardless of the degree of battery discharge, 
the device starts charging until the maximum charge.
Many parameters can be defined in the main.h file: critical temperatures of the LM317 and battery, 
the time to turn on the LED lamp after dark, the intervals between measurements of the battery and solar panel, 
the time and minimum number of charging cycles.
