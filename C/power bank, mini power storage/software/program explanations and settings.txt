The program provides for cooperation with the LI-FE-PO4 battery pack connected in series. The program cannot set rigid voltage values, thanks to which it is possible to configure the number of cells in the package.
Configuration in main.h file is very important. Depending on the type of battery, the nominal and maximum voltage should be set as a percentage in relation to the maximum voltage of the cells. 
This is very important because the device based on these values decides to load the package and turn off the load.
During the first start, the device charges the battery pack to check the maximum voltage of the packet. 
The main.h file allows you to set the charging time after reaching the state when the battery voltage does not increase and the number of cycles. 
The program processes maintenance charging by the number of cycles that can be set in this file. Critical temperature values on NTC sensors are also set.
This program provides power to the bulb for about 3 hours after dark. The time can be determined by TIME_OF_LIGHTING. The unit is about 0.5 seconds.
