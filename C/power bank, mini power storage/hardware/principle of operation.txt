The device works as a power bank or mini energy storage, charging batteries with solar energy. The device requires a battery and a solar panel. 
The maximum voltage of the battery and solar panel depends on the elements used. 
The project with the values of the element from the scheme is designed for maximum voltage of the solar panel and battery max 22V.
The following types of ecumulators can be used: NIMH, NICD, LI-ION, NIMH, lead-acid. WARNING! Cells must be equipped with balancers.
Hardware has one programmable input or output. Look at the diagram. For example, a motion sensor or button can be connected to the input. 
The output can be controlled, for example, by balancing machines or heating batteries on cold days.
The presented project will control the output connected to heating batteries.
The device is equipped with LM317 which we can control (R17) battery charging current. We set the output voltage LM2596 supplying LM317 with the R13 and R14 resistors. 
Remember that LM317 must have a minimum supply voltage of 3V higher than the load voltage.
The RGB LED indicates the status of the device. 2 NTC temperature sensors measure the temperature of LM317 and the battery pack.
