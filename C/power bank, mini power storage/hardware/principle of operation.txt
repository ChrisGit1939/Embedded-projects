The hardware is designed to connect a power source, battery and load. Depending on the software version, it can power IoT devices, LED lamps, charge small devices: smartphones, tablets, etc.
Designed to work ATtiny24/44/84.
The power and battery connectors are connected to the microcontroller's ADC channels. The resistive battery voltage divider can be turned off to avoid loading the battery. The load connector is controlled by a MOSFET transistor; it can be freely programmed.
The battery charging system is equipped with LM2596-adj, and current stabilization - the voltage and current can be freely configured. Charging can be turned on or off by a microcontroller or by using a Zener diode.
The hardware is equipped with 2 NTC sensors to measure the temperature of the LM317 and the battery.
The hardware can handle any battery. The hardware components shown in the diagram will handle a 10V - 18V battery, but changing the LM2596 will allow for a wider voltage range. Depending on the battery type, a cell balancer and deep discharge protection are required.
The RGB LED can indicate the device status. The red color is controlled by PWM.
The hardware has one programmable digital input or output that can be assigned to any purpose. The input is optically isolated, the OC output with a small output current used for control - not powering other devices.
